Warami High School has a very small staff car park. They have a total of 30 spaces allocated for 120 staff members (including Student Administration and Support), split across the 10 faculties of:
- English – 15 teachers
- Mathematics – 13 teachers
- Science – 10 teachers
- Technological and Applied Studies (TAS) – 12 teachers
- Creative and Performing Arts (CAPA) – 7 teachers
- Personal Development, Health and Physical Education (PD/H/PE) – 7 teachers
- History and Languages – 7 teachers
- Human Society and Its Environment (HSIE) – 9 teachers
- Learning Support – 6 teachers
- Student Administration and Support – 34 staff members

The number of teachers for each faculty is given above. There are a total of 10 files provided, one representing each faculty, that need to be read into the program. In each file, there are the names of each of the teachers.

A timetable of how many spaces each faculty gets per day as well as who gets what spot each day for a two-week cycle needs to be generated.

The program must:
- Present a form for the user to select the files containing the names for each faculty.
- Read in the names of each of the teachers in each of the faculties from the files.
- Display which faculty has which spaces on what days along with the teachers’ names using a graphical method such as a block of colour or a picture of a car in a car park. The user needs to be able to click on ‘Monday’ and get the allocations for Monday, or ‘Tuesday’ for Tuesday’s allocations etc. Teachers do not have to get the same days in a row, nor do they have to have the same spots each day.

The program should also:
- Ensure that 50% of each faculty is allocated a parking spot in the fortnight.
- Give the user the option to either read in the names of each teacher from the files or to enter each teacher’s name manually and the number of days each teacher is in per fortnight.
- Have some sort of menu system that allows the user to switch between the default mode as specified in the ‘must’ section, and this optional mode.

The program could also:
- Ensure that 70% of each faculty is allocated a parking spot in the fortnight.
- Allow the user to change the number of staff members per faculty so long as the total of 120 staff members is reached. This means that the user should be presented with a form with each faculty name and associated input box with how many staff members are in each faculty.
- Increase or decrease the number of total staff members in the school car parking timetable. This should in turn check to see that the total entered does not exceed the number of total staff members.
